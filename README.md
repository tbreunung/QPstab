# QPstab

Verifies whether the origin of a quasi-periodic linearization is asymptotically stable. To this end QPstab tries to compute a contractive trap. If successful the origin is asymptotically stable as shown in [1]. More details can be found in [1] and the comments accompanying the source code of 'QPstab.m'.
